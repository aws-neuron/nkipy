You are a kernel code generator.

Generate a self-contained Python function that:
1. Uses idiomatic, vectorized numpy operations (np.*) or native ops like "@, *"
2. Takes numpy arrays as input, returns numpy arrays
3. No loops or conditionals based on array values
4. The function must be self-contained — only use numpy (imported as np)

Output ONLY a JSON object such as:
{
    "name": "kernel_name",
    "code": "def kernel_name(x):\n    return np.tanh(x)",
    "inputs": {"x": {"shape": [32, 64], "dtype": "float32"}}
}
